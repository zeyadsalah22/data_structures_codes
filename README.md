# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++. Each data structure is implemented in a separate file for easy understanding and reference. Below is a brief overview of each data structure along with links to external resources for further reading.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **File:** `Binary_search_tree.cpp`
- **Description:** A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure that allows fast lookup, addition, and deletion of elements. In a BST, each node has at most two child nodes: a left child and a right child. The key property of a BST is that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

## Circular Queue
- **File:** `Circular_queue.cpp`
- **Description:** A circular queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It is similar to a regular queue but with a fixed size. Once the queue is full, adding a new element to it will overwrite the oldest element in the queue.

## Priority Queue
- **File:** `Priority_queue.cpp`
- **Description:** A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements based on their priority. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority. It is commonly implemented using a heap data structure.

## Queue
- **File:** `Queue.cpp`
- **Description:** A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue.

## Queue using Linked List
- **File:** `Queue_linked_list.cpp`
- **Description:** A queue implemented using a linked list data structure. It has the same FIFO behavior as a regular queue but with dynamic memory allocation.

## Stack
- **File:** `Stack.cpp`
- **Description:** A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

## Stack using Linked List
- **File:** `Stack_linked_list.cpp`
- **Description:** A stack implemented using a linked list data structure. It has the same LIFO behavior as a regular stack but with dynamic memory allocation.

## Linked List
- **File:** `linked_list.cpp`
- **Description:** A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence. It provides efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

## Shift Down Queue
- **File:** `shift_down_queue.cpp`
- **Description:** A variant of the circular queue where, after dequeuing an element, all remaining elements shift down to occupy the emptied space, ensuring that the queue remains compact and contiguous.
